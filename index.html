	<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>The Electromagnetic Movement Systems Project or E.M.M.S., is a project that experiments with the effect of using electromagnetic forces as a propellant. This is similar to a magnetic-levitation train (Maglev). Maglevs use a technology similar to that of a railgun however, the technology for this project is closer to that of a coilgun. A coilgun or Gauss Gun/Rifle, is a smaller form of a particle accelerator that uses an air-coil to propel pieces of metal. This is called a solenoid. This project aims at using coilgun technology to make a vehicle that may be more efficient and faster than a classic Maglev Train. The reasons why we are experimenting with this project, is because there  is a possibility that this can damage smart-phones and other radio communication devices.</p>

	<h3>Research Question:</h3>
	<p>How much electromagnetic force can be exerted on an iPhone and Android smartphone before negative effects such as data corruption or radio interference start to take place?</p>
